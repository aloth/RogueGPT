## The Research Mandate: Why RogueGPT Exists
To empirically study how humans perceive AI-generated news, researchers require a reliable and highly controllable source of stimuli. RogueGPT serves as the dedicated **stimulus generation engine** for the JudgeGPT research project. Its purpose is to create a diverse and methodologically sound dataset of news fragments under specific, reproducible conditions.

This project is one half of a complete research pipeline. While its sister project, **[JudgeGPT](https://github.com/aloth/JudgeGPT)**, is the data collection platform where humans evaluate news authenticity, RogueGPT is the tool that creates the very content to be evaluated. This two-part structure is essential for maintaining experimental control and ensuring the integrity of the research findings, as outlined in our foundational paper, *"Blessing or curse? A survey on the Impact of Generative AI on Fake News"*.

## The Research Pipeline: From Generation to Judgment
RogueGPT is the starting point in our end-to-end experimental workflow. It provides a user interface for researchers to generate news fragments with precise control over numerous variables. This process allows us to systematically investigate how different factors influence human perception of authenticity.

### The Experimental Workflow
The process flows from controlled generation to human judgment, creating a rich dataset that links specific content characteristics to perception scores:

1.  **Controlled Stimulus Generation (`RogueGPT`):** A researcher utilizes the `RogueGPT` interface to generate news fragments. The generation process is highly controlled, using specific variables defined in a configuration file (`prompt_engine.json`). These variables include parameters such as news outlet `Style` (e.g., 'NYT', 'BILD'), `Format` ('tweet', 'short article'), `Language` ('en', 'de'), and the underlying `GeneratorModel` (e.g., 'openai_gpt-4-turbo_2024-04-09').

2.  **Data Storage (MongoDB):** Each generated fragment, along with its full metadata (the parameters used to create it), is stored in a shared MongoDB database. This is handled by the `save_fragment` function within RogueGPT's codebase, which uses the PyMongo library to interact with the database.

3.  **Human Data Collection (`JudgeGPT`):** A participant accesses the `JudgeGPT` survey application. The application retrieves a fragment generated by RogueGPT from the MongoDB collection to present to the user.

4.  **Judgment and Analysis:** The participant reads the news fragment and uses sliders to rate its perceived authenticity and origin. This judgment data is then saved back to the database, creating a comprehensive record that links specific generation parameters to quantitative human perception scores.

## 📢 Calling All Experts: Share Your Insights!
Are you an expert in AI, policy, or journalism? We are conducting a follow-up study to gather expert perspectives on the risks and mitigation strategies related to AI-driven disinformation. Your insights are invaluable for this research.

Please consider contributing by participating in our 15-minute survey:
**➡️ [https://forms.gle/EUdbkEtZpEuPbVVz5](https://forms.gle/EUdbkEtZpEuPbVVz5)**

* **Purpose**: This survey explores expert perceptions of generative-AI–driven disinformation for an academic research project.
* **Data Use**: All responses will be treated as confidential and reported in an anonymised, aggregated format by default. At the end of the survey, you will have the option to be publicly acknowledged for your contribution. All data will be used for academic purposes only.
* **Time**: Approximately 15 minutes.

## Technical Deep Dive
This section provides a comprehensive guide for developers and technical users who wish to run, inspect, or contribute to the RogueGPT project locally.

### System Architecture
The project is built with the following components:

* **Frontend/Backend:** A **Streamlit** application (`app.py`) written in Python provides the user interface for both manual and automated news fragment generation.
* **Configuration:** A `prompt_engine.json` file defines the parameters for automated generation, including prompt templates, styles, languages, and target generative models.
* **Database:** A **MongoDB** (NoSQL) database is used to store the generated news fragments and their associated metadata.

### Local Installation and Setup
Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine.

1.  **Prerequisites**
    * Python 3.8+
    * pip package manager
    * Git

2.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/aloth/RogueGPT.git](https://github.com/aloth/RogueGPT.git)
    cd RogueGPT
    ```

3.  **Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended)**
    ```bash
    # For macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

4.  **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    Key dependencies include `streamlit`, `pymongo`, and `openai`.

5.  **Configure Environment Variables**
    The application requires a connection string to a MongoDB database and potentially API keys for generative models. It is best practice to manage these secrets using environment variables.

### Running the Application
Once the setup is complete, launch the Streamlit application:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
The application will open in your default web browser, presenting two tabs: "Generator" for automated creation and "Manual Data Entry" for direct input.

## Project Roadmap: A Research-Driven Agenda
The roadmap for RogueGPT is focused on enhancing its capabilities as a state-of-the-art stimulus generation engine.

### Expanding Modalities: Beyond Text to Deepfakes
To support the broader research goals of the JudgeGPT project, a key priority is to expand RogueGPT's capabilities to include the generation and incorporation of **images and other visual media**. This will enable the study of multimedia and "deepfake" disinformation.

### Enhancing Realism and Deception
To keep pace with the "technological arms race," the research must test human perception against an ever-wider array of sophisticated models. The roadmap includes the integration of a greater variety of generative models, such as **BERT, T5, and other emerging LLMs**, allowing for more nuanced and diverse content generation.

### Building Trust and Mitigation Systems
Future work includes building a **content verification layer** and integrating with established **fact-checking services**. This would allow RogueGPT to not only generate content but also to annotate it with veracity scores, enabling new lines of research into misinformation mitigation and "inoculation" theories.
